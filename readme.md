Reputation Bars
===============

Reputation Bars is a modular addon that lets you watch one or more faction
standings, i.e. the amount of reputation you have with them. It can be used
to track specific factions or automatically track the ones you gain rep with.
It is especially useful for those with custom UIs that no longer have the
default Blizzard rep bar available.

You can use this while leveling to see your reputation bar or simply as a way
to show you how much you have left for various factions as you grind your
way to exalted...
